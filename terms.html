        <br>

   <hr>

   <div class="col-fluid">
    <p>These terms and conditions will serve as a basis of your banking relationship with us, Kuda Microfinance Bank Limited (“Kuda or Bank” ). By choosing to open an account with us, you agree to the terms and conditions contained herein. You also confirm that you have provided us with the accurate and complete information required to create your account and that you have supplied all documentation, photographs and information that allow us to comply with our regulatory obligations.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not proceed and exit the application immediately. Also, please be informed that we can terminate your relationship with us if we believe that you have violated any of these terms.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-fluid">
<p style="text-align: left; color: #401C66;" class="fs-3 fw-bolder ">About Us</p>
<p>Kuda is a full service digital microfinance bank that is duly licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (“CBN”). Our registered office is at 151 Herbert Macaulay Rd, Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-fluid">
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #401C66;" class="fs-3 fw-bolder ">Objective of relationship</p>
  <p>The objective of establishing a relationship with Kuda is to receive special services on offer by Kuda for its customers. Kuda will manage a bank account for the customer, as well as provide additional services like the banking, savings and granting of credit facilities.</p>
  <p>You can operate and manage your account via our Kuda app and the prerequisite for opening an account is a smartphone, with an active phone number, that meets our minimum technology requirements for operating system (iOS/Android) and supports the latest version of our Kuda app.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-fluid">
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #401C66;" class="fs-3 fw-bolder ">When are these terms applicable?</p>
  <p>These terms are applicable when you choose to open an account with Kuda and Kuda generates an account number for you</p>
  <p>We may, at any time, modify the terms and conditions of our relationship but we will not do this without first informing you of such modification. All updates will be detailed on our website and our app. You will be able to access the latest version of our terms at any given time.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-fluid">
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #401C66;" class="fs-3 fw-bolder ">What is the scope of the relationship between Kuda & the customer?</p>
  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Opening an Account</p>
  <p>You can open an account with us on the condition that you are at least 18 years old, a Nigerian citizen, meet our technology requirements defined above and have not yet opened an account with us. We do not knowingly engage with people who don’t meet these conditions.</p>
  <p>When you choose to open an account, you agree to us using your information to make and receive payments on your behalf through your Kuda account. If you would like us to stop doing this, we would have to close your account.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Verifying your identity</p>
  <p>Banking regulations require us to verify your identity before we can open an account for you. At the very least, there needs to be an active phone number, your profile picture and BVN supplied. With more information supplied, such as valid identification documents, we will be able to open an account without any restrictions. Our accounts are tiered as follows:</p>

  <p><img src="pictures/terms.jpeg" class="img-fluid col-sm" alt="..."></p>
  <p>In line with regulations, we perform due diligence on all accounts so it is your responsibility to keep your mailing address, email address, physical address and other contact information up-to-date in your profile.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Language and communication</p>
  <p>English will be the primary language of our communication to you. We may use emojis or colloquialisms, but we will always communicate in English.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about your relationship with Kuda, you can contact us via email using the details below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: <span><a href="mailto:help@kudabank.com?subject=Making Enquiry" style="text-decoration: none;">help@kudabank.com</a></span></li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Notifications</p>
  <p>By opening an account with us, you consent to receiving text (SMS), email and push notifications from us. These notifications are meant for your consumption only and we will not be held liable if you suffer any loss, or damage as a result of unauthorised access to the information sent.</p>
  <p>In addition, by opening this account, you agree to opt out of mandatory SMS alerts directed by the CBN in favor of push notifications. You agree to indemnify Kuda against all losses, damages, claims, demands and expenses whatsoever which may be incurred, imposed or suffered by the Bank as well as against all actions, proceedings or claims (including attorney's fees) whether civil or criminal, which may be brought against Kuda by reason of such notifications.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Spending Account</p>
  <p>With the Kuda spending account, you will be able to fund your Kuda account via bank transfers, cash at selected partner banks, and a stored card. You will be able to pay bills, make instant transfers, manage your Kuda card and save as you spend. These activities are subject to the following limits:</p>
  <p><img src="pictures/terms2.jpeg" class="img-fluid col-sm" alt="..."></p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Spend & Save</p>
  <p>Upon enrolment in Spend & Save, we will transfer a user-determined percentage of any user-induced debit on your account to an interest earning sub-account. This feature can be enabled and disabled from the Spend & Save section of the app.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Kuda Card</p>
  <p>The Kuda MasterCard is issued by Zenith Bank, pursuant to a license from MasterCard Incorporated. When we issue you a card, it must be used for only lawful transactions within Nigeria. The card will have an expiry date and is valid until the last day of the month shown on the card. Your card will be auto-renewed upon expiration, unless your account is closed or the card is revoked.</p>
  <p>The PIN issued with your card enables you to carry out transactions such as withdrawals and purchases from ATMs, Point of Sale terminals and Web/Online platforms.</p>
  <p>When you use your card for transactions on other channels which are not owned and controlled by the Bank, the rules of use of that channel apply in addition to these rules.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Kuda Save</p>
  <p>Kuda Save helps you save money with minimal effort. To do this, we can either debit your Kuda Bank account at user-determined frequency or you can make a one-time lump sum savings. Upon expiration of the tenor, the accumulated funds will be transferred to your Kuda Bank account. You can make withdrawals prior to the expiration of the tenor. This can be done at no charge for recurring savings, but for one-time lump sum savings, there will be a charge. This charge is either the interest earned if fixed or 5% of the amount withdrawn if flexible.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">When things go wrong</p>
  <p>To protect your money, we need you to keep your card, phone and PIN safe at all times. If you lose your card or spot any suspicious transactions on your account, please freeze your card and inform us as soon as possible. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your passwords, PINs, or any other identifier that you use to access your bank account and our services. Use a strong password and a unique code as your transaction PIN and limit its use to your Kuda account. Do not allow anyone to have or use your password or transaction PIN details. If you share these details, we cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left; " class="fs-5 fw-bold ">Closing an account</p>
  <p>You can close your account at any time and at no cost. If you’d like to do this, please get in touch with us. You will, however, remain liable for any obligations related to your account with us. Once the account is closed, you will not be able to access any Kuda services.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to close, suspend, freeze or limit access to your account, if:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The information we obtain from you does not comply with regulatory requirements;</li>
    <li>You do not meet, or are in breach of, the terms and conditions contained herein;</li>
    <li>You create risk or possible legal exposure to us;</li>

Therefore, we reserve the right to terminate your account without incurring any liability. We are also under no obligation to make any payment under, or otherwise to open this account if you violate any OFAC, EU, UN and HTM sanctions or there is involvement by any person (natural, corporate or governmental) listed in the OFAC, EU, UN, HMT or local sanctions lists, or any involvement by or nexus with Cuba, Sudan, North Korea, Iran or Myanmar or such other countries as may be included from time to time in the sanctions list, or any of their governmental agencies.</p>
  <p>In addition, Kuda is required to comply with all extant laws in Nigeria, including the rules, regulations, guidelines, circulars and letters issued by the CBN and other regulatory bodies from time to time. In compliance with the applicable laws, Kuda does not deal in crypto currencies and does not facilitate payments for crypto currency transactions and other related transactions. You, therefore, confirm that you will not use your Kuda account to deal in, trade, transact or receive any payments relating to virtual currencies.</p>
